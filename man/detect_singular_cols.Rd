\title{Detect constant or singular columns (including interactions) per fold}
\usage{
detect_singular_cols(data_proc, exposure, response, outcome, strata, folds)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_proc}{Data frame containing the preprocessed dataset}

\item{exposure}{Name of exposure variable (character)}

\item{response}{Name of response variable (character)}

\item{strata}{Name of strata variable (character)}

\item{folds}{Binary matrix of complementary folds (rows = obs, cols = folds)}
}
\value{
Character vector of column names that are constant in at least one fold
}
\description{
Checks each variable (and its interaction with exposure) for being constant
within complementary folds. Works for numeric, factor, and mixed variables.
